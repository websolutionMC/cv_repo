      aboutMe: "I'm a graduate of Computer Science faculty with specialization in Software Engineering on University of Technology in Rzeszow. I started my programming career in Netspace company in Rzeszow, where I worked as a Fullstack developer. Through the years of work I gained valuable experience and learned a lot of new technologies. I learned to optimize the code. I am looking for a job as a backend developer, which will allow me to further personal development. I learn new technologies quickly. My interests include artificial intelligence, on which I wrote and defended my master's thesis.",
